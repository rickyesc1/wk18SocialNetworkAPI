# Social Media API 

A REST api application allowing the creation of users and their thoughts and reactions to the thoughts. 

## Description

This app is an exemplary example of how to use insomnia when testing routes, and how you can use insomnia with CRUD methods as well. 

Because this application is not deployed, I have attached a walkthrough video demonstrating how to see all of the users, how to get one single user by their id, how to create a new User and Delete that User as well, and how to update the details of users, adding friends and removing friends as well. 

The routes available also show the detailes for the thought routes (user thoughts which are part of the social media app)

## Video 

Here is the walkthrough video for the user routes: (video)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F_YQqnDOsTa2wGtXYwzInSuMLnrl4j5d/view]

And here is the video for the thought routes  (two videos had to be taken because my free subscription only allowed for videos up to 5 minutes): (video2)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F_YQqnDOsTa2wGtzYwzInSuMKnrl5j5d/view]

## Technology Used

The purpose behind this project was to have to use and showcase the usage of MongoDB (a cross-platform document database similar to MySQL but with greater capabilities and scalability). Paired with Mongo is the usage of Compass, a Mongo component.

The second most important aspect we wanted to highlight/show off was the usage of Insomnia (a framework that "incorporates user-friendly interface and sophisticated features such as security helpers, code creation, and environment variables"). Insomnia was especially useful in testing our API routes (restful API's a preference when testing with insomnia, although other types such as GraphQL can also be tested.)

Lastly we also showcased Node, Express, inquirer, bash, and VS Code as we have done so so many times previously. 

## Installation

- Make sure that you have installed MongoDB, Compass, Insomnia, Express, and Node. 
- Clone this repository to your local machine however you choose to do so 
- Navigate to the directory in gitBash/Terminal
- run the commands "npm i" or "npm install" to install the dependencies
- then run "node server.js" to start the app and connect to the database
- Open INSOMNIA and follow the instructions either from the walkthrtough video or start testing the correct routes whcih can be found in the /routes/api/:fileName folders .
