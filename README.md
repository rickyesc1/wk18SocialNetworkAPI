# Social Media API 

A REST api application allowing the creation of users and their thoughts and reactions to the thoughts. 

## Description

This app is an exemplary example of how to use insomnia when testing routes, and how you can use insomnia with CRUD methods as well. 

Because this application is not deployed, I have attached a walkthrough video demonstrating how to see all of the users, how to get one single user by their id, how to create a new User and Delete that User as well, and how to update the details of users, adding friends and removing friends as well. 

The routes available also show the detailes for the thought routes (user thoughts which are part of the social media app)

## Video 

Here is the walkthrough video for the user routes: (video)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F_YQqnDOsTa2wGtXYwzInSuMLnrl4j5d/view]

And here is the video for the thought routes  (two videos had to be taken because my free subscription only allowed for videos up to 5 minutes): (video2)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F_YQqnDOsTa2wGtzYwzInSuMKnrl5j5d/view]
